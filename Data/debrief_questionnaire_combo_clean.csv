5584809,start,difficult,easier,difficult,"I normally memorize words by using associations between how they are spelt and other similarly spelt words. It was much easier to do that if I saw the English spelling. The Arabic made it harder because somehow needing to think about the harakat threw me off. Also, I found it hard to remember the last letter in the Arabic spelling. I think it has something to do with being coached so much to remember the root of the word in verbs, that my brain goes straight to the first three letters and ignores the last one (since the end of the word would be the one that's conjugated). Of course, most of the words in the quick were probably made to resemble ""ism al-fa'el"" words but my brain still kept ignoring the last letter. ",in_arabic,green_tick,"In this excercise, it was much faster for me to memorize words and make associatons when I saw their English spelling. However, I also know that the quality of my learning (i.e., actually learning the arabic world properly) improves if it is in arabic. Often, I don't catch the right letters (particularly for the ones that non-Arabic speakers have trouble learning like ha, hha, d, dha, tha, etc.) if I don't see them written in Arabic. Also, I know more intuitively where to stress the word if I can see whether the vowel is a letter or just a harakat. Finally, I find it much easier to remember a word if I understand where the grammar is coming from. If I learnt 'madis' (the hippopotamus toy thing) with just the English, I wouldn't really catch that it was m-d-s in the ism-fael format. By seeing it in Arabic, I know what the word is 'trying to do'. That way, I just have to remember three letters and how to apply it, rather than rote learning how to say it (which in my experience is always more difficult and much more prone to mistakes). If I can induldge myself in being super pretentious for a moment -- I really think that I only have full access to the ontology of Arabic if I see it written down.
