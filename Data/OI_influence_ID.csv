Or the person speaking the word may have an accent, so things like vowels or inflections can get misinterpretted. The funniest instance of this is hearing new songs for the first time – I'm 98% guarenteed to sing several words/lines of the song wrong, because my brain fills in what it think's it's hearing with the first word it sounds like to me. But on googling the lyrics, I see what the artist is actually singing about.
